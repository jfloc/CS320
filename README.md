How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my program has functional and secure code I am able to apply analyzation techniques such as 
using a diagram that achieves all code paths and ensures that all path variables are able to be chosen. I can also ensure that I use
development strategies such as Test Driven development so that I will not code based on just the prompt but rather on the requirements
and standards that the code is requesting to be had.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I will first follow the standards requested, secondly I will in the future work with the user to do user acceptance testing
as well as test it myself from the point of the user by using black box testing to see if the program works as it should be used.

How do I approach designing software?
I can use Test Driven Development techniques as well as other variety of technqiues such as following a V-shaped model
that helps with the approach of keeping the software secure through means of testing.
